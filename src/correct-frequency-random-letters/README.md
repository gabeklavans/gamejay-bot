I had to lift the source code from the [actual npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/correct-frequency-random-letters) because the use of ES6 module import syntax in the compiled dist js was giving my tsc + node a hard time.

I wrote none of the code in this folder. All credit goes to original author [timbrownls20](https://github.com/timbrownls20)
